Elimu is an independent project—currently in progress—that I’m working on in my final semester of college.
It is a supplemental Learning Management System (LMS) focused on elementary school students.

I designed Elimu with underserved communities in mind. It’s meant to be a lightweight and scalable LMS that works well in low-resource environments and on low-end devices, with a strong focus on simplicity, accessibility, and collaboration for both students and teachers.

Elimu is intended to supplement in-class learning, not replace it. It provides a fun and interactive way for students to continue engaging with educational content outside the classroom.

# Features:
Built using Dart and Flutter for the frontend.

Firebase handles authentication, storage, and database services.

Kid-friendly UI

Role-based experience for students, teachers, and admins.

Core functionality includes: assignments, quizzes, messaging, class resources, and teacher dashboards.

# Future of Elimu:
Add support for offline caching to make the platform more robust in areas with unreliable internet.

Integrate quiz auto-grading and progress analytics for teachers.

Explore the use of voice notes and multilingual support to enhance accessibility.

Optimize UI for mobile devices to ensure smooth cross-platform usage.
